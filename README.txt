click the "guess" button to start
 
The computer will randomly select and display - to the user - either a "Fruit" or a "Vegetable" image. Simultaneously - underneath the image, the computer will display a "Fruit" button and a "Vegetable" button

The player must identify whether the image is a "Fruit" or a "Vegetable" by clicking on either one of the buttons

If the player selects the correct answer - the player will be notified that they are correct

If the player selects an incorrect answer - the player will loose a life

If the "image" is a "Fruit" and the player select the correct answer - the player will be notified that they are correct and the fruit will be placed into it's corresponding box (underneath)

If the "image" is a "Vegetable" and the player selects the correct answer - the player will be notified that they are correct

If the player finds all 16 fruits - without loosing all 3 lives - the player will be notiified that they have won

If at any point the player looses all 3 lives - they will be notified that they have lost - and the "game over" page will be displayed.
